# EVAN'S FUNNEST AWESOME CRAFT
## aka EFAC
Evan's Funnest Awesome Craft (or EFAC) is a minecraft mod + reskin that i have been cooking on and off since February of last year! It is heavily inspired by CallMeCarson's texture pack exchange videos, but I think it has a character of its own. I am not named Evan. The name came to be after my friend Piper suggested "even funnest awesome craft" and I mistyped and thought it was funnier. The goal is to completely change all of minecraft's textures, sounds, and music as well as add more original story and content to explore.
